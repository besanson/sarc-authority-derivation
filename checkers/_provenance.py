Ported verbatim with attribution from sarc-suite-one-pass's
checkers/_provenance.py (commit 782261e) -- see ADR-001. Unchanged except
this docstring.

Shared provenance helpers for checkers/.

`head_sha()`: every checker's output JSON is stamped with the git HEAD
commit at generation time, under the key "generated_at_head_sha". This is
an informational stamp for a human skimming a JSON file, not what
freshness is defined by (see `inputs_hash` below) -- a HEAD-based check
would flag every publication-only commit (README edits, unrelated files)
as staleness even when nothing the checker actually reads has changed.

`inputs_hash()`: a sha256 over the literal bytes of the checker's own
declared generating inputs -- its source module(s) and any config file it
reads. FRESHNESS IS DEFINED BY inputs_hash, not generated_at_head_sha: a
checker artifact is fresh if and only if recomputing inputs_hash from the
CURRENT tree reproduces the hash the committed artifact already carries.
