Deterministic, portable arXiv submission tarball for this repository's own
paper-tex/ (main.tex + refs.bib) -- built with Python's tarfile module,
never a system `tar` binary.

Why not shell out (the sibling's own `arxiv` target does: `tar
--sort=name --mtime='UTC 2026-01-01' --owner=0 --group=0 --numeric-owner
-cf arxiv.tar.gz main.tex refs.bib`): that invocation is GNU-tar-only --
`--sort=name` is not implemented by the BSD tar macOS ships, confirmed by
the second independent reproduction attempt
(besanson/sarc-authority-derivation#2), which hit exactly this packaging
the sibling's OWN arxiv.tar.gz (its pinned Makefile must not be edited --
bootstrap.sh's own preflight now arranges for GNU tar to be on PATH for
that one delegated command instead; see REPRODUCTION.md's Corrections).
For this repository's OWN packaging, the more direct fix is to not depend
on any system tar binary at all: the standard library's tarfile module
needs nothing external and behaves identically on every platform Python
itself runs on.

`tarfile.open(mode="w:gz")` alone is not quite enough for byte-identical
output across runs: it always stamps the gzip container's own header with
the current wall-clock time, unless the gzip layer is opened explicitly
with a fixed `mtime` (a bare `tarfile.open` gives no way to pass one
through). The gzip layer is therefore built explicitly below.
